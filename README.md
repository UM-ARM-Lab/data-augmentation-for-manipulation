# Data Augmentation for Manipulation

The `augmentation` folder contains most of the code for generating augmentations, but the specific implementations for rope manipulation and planar pushing are contained within the `scenario` classes inside of `link_bot_pycommon`.

# A simple demo

In the coming months I plan to make a simple demo based on the the cylinders planar pushing example.
